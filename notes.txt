Observables
  - working with streams
  - values over time
  - functional programming

Observer is a software design pattern
in which an object called the subject
maintains a list of its dependents called
observers and notifies them automatically
of any state changes usually by calling
one of their methods.

stream is similar to raw dough/data
data arrives over time
we call that flow of data stream.

as data flows through our stream we can:
- process it
- transform it
operators

then when we are done processin our streams of data,
we send it to our subscribers or customers

reactive extension library is specifically rxjs library
which is specifically desgined for handling observable
streams of data

we wll start to see the streams of data from values arrive
over the dimension of time and it is going ot be functional
